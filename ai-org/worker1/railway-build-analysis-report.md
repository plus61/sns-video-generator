# Railway Build Logs Analysis Report - Worker1

## Summary

As Worker1, I have analyzed the Railway build status for the sns-video-generator project. Here are my findings:

## Current Status

### Git Commit Status
- **Latest Commit**: 81b449a "Fix Railway deployment with custom server and module resolution"
- **Status**: Committed and pushed to origin/main
- **Timestamp**: Fri Jun 20 13:01:18 2025 +0900

### Configuration Analysis

#### 1. Railway Configuration Files
- **railway.json**: ✅ Correctly configured
  - Uses custom Dockerfile: `Dockerfile.custom-server`
  - Builder type: DOCKERFILE
  - Health check configured: `/api/health`
  
- **railway.toml**: ⚠️ Potential Issue
  - Start command: `node .next/standalone/server.js`
  - But railway.json points to custom server solution

#### 2. Custom Server Solution
- **server.js**: ✅ Created with path alias resolution
- **Dockerfile.custom-server**: ✅ Created for Railway deployment
- Custom server handles `@/` import path resolution at runtime

#### 3. Build Configuration
- **next.config.mjs**: Updated with webpack aliases
- **tsconfig.json**: Modified for better module resolution
- **package.json**: Railway-specific build scripts added

## Key Findings

### 1. Configuration Mismatch
There's a potential conflict between:
- `railway.json` → Uses custom Dockerfile with `server.js`
- `railway.toml` → Points to `.next/standalone/server.js`

**This could cause build confusion on Railway platform**

### 2. Custom Server Solution
The commit implements a comprehensive fix:
- Custom server.js handles module resolution
- Dockerfile.custom-server builds the application
- Path aliases resolved at runtime

### 3. Previous Issues Addressed
Based on historical documents:
- Next.js 15 async API issues: Fixed
- LightningCSS problems: Resolved
- Module resolution errors: Addressed with custom server

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify Railway Dashboard**
   - Check if build is using railway.json or railway.toml
   - Confirm Dockerfile.custom-server is being used

2. **Configuration Alignment**
   - Either update railway.toml to use `node server.js`
   - Or ensure railway.json takes precedence

3. **Build Log Verification**
   - Need access to Railway dashboard to see actual build logs
   - Check if custom Dockerfile is being executed

### Potential Issues to Monitor
1. **Module Resolution**: Custom server should handle `@/` imports
2. **Static Files**: Dockerfile copies public and .next/static
3. **Health Check**: Endpoint should respond at `/api/health`

## Conclusion

The commit 81b449a implements a comprehensive solution for Railway deployment issues. However, there's a configuration mismatch between railway.json and railway.toml that needs resolution. Without access to actual Railway build logs, I cannot determine if the build is failing or if the configuration mismatch is causing issues.

**Next Step**: Access Railway dashboard to view actual build logs and deployment status.
