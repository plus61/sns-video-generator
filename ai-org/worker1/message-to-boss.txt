WORKER1 STATUS REPORT

✅ COMPLETED: Fixed 500 Internal Server Error Issue

Root Cause:
- Turbopack (Next.js experimental bundler) was causing all API endpoints to return 500 errors
- This affected both API routes and page rendering

Solution Implemented:
- Identified the issue through systematic testing
- Started dev server without Turbopack: npx next dev -p 3001
- All API endpoints now working correctly

Test Results:
- /api/health/simple: ✅ 200 OK
- /api/debug: ✅ 200 OK (all env vars confirmed)
- /api/test-basic: ✅ 200 OK
- /test-minimal page: ✅ 200 OK
- /api/test-supabase: ⚠️ 400 (network connectivity issue, not related to 500 error)

Next Steps:
1. Update development scripts to avoid Turbopack
2. Investigate Supabase network issue separately
3. Ready for Railway deployment
